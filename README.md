# Twitter-popularity-predictor
The repository contains all the material and the code of the project. The code implements an algorithm to predict the popularity of tweets about a certain domain, for example the food domain. This project has been developed by me for an exam of the Master degree course. The algorithm is implemented using 'classical' machine learning techniques.
